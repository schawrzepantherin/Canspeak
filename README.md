# TinExplorer

This project is an offline exploration device built inside metal tins. It combines three core functions every explorer needs: a walkie-talkie style radio communicator, a standalone music player, and a read-only map (demo feature, as of now can feature location up to a 10km radius).

The device is designed so that the lid contains the radio system and the maps, a read-only display of downloaded map tiles with a red dot at the center representing the user (again, these maps are offline and there is no routing). The music player contained in the main body of the tin allows you to play music offline and functions independently of the radio and maps.

# Why I made this

I wanted to build an exploration device that doesnt need wi-fi to function, and that doesnt force me to carry seperate devices which I'd have to lug around, so, I built this project to maximise efficiency. Whenever I'm outside exploring, especially somewhere I've never been, the three things I need are maps, music, and communication.

Obviously we have phones for this purpose, but, this project is about simplicity. The maps are minimalist because they are meant only for awarness. The radio exists for direct communication without interference, the music player because I think it's an exploration need. In the end, I prioritised autonomy and necessity while designing this device.

Building this also allowed me to explore radio communication, power management, and hardware-software integration, while teaching myself how to design something functional with very limited space.
